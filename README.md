This notebook provides an open-source implementation of the protocol presented in the paper: 

Graser, A. (2021) An exploratory data analysis protocol for identifying problems in continuous movement data. *Journal of Location Based Services.* http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17489725.2021.1900612.

The individual protocol steps are demonstrated using a dataset of vessel tracking data (AIS) published by the Danish Maritime Authority. The demo data covers two days (July, 1st 2017 and January, 1st 2018). Since the datasets are too large for Github, they have been made available via Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11577543
